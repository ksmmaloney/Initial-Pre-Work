        <p class="summary"> Without her work, modern programming and the software development that allow everyday people to operate computers would not have been possible. She pioneered the development of the COBOL computer language that has made computers accessible to the world.

    <h4>Timeline</h4> 
    <ul class= "list-of-dates">
        <li><strong>1906</strong> &mdash; Grace Brewster Murray is born in New York City on December 9, the oldest of three children. </li>
        <li><strong>1924</strong> &mdash; Enrolls at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, NY, one of the first universities in the US to grant degrees to women. </li>
        <li> <strong>1928</strong> &mdash; Graduates Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics.</li>
        <li><strong>1930</strong> &mdash; Earns a master's degree in mathematics from Yale University. Marries Vincent Hopper the same year and accepts a teaching position at Vassar, continuing her own education while she teaches.</li>
        <li><strong>1934</strong> &mdash; Earns a PhD in mathematics from Yale University.
         <li><strong>1941</strong> &mdash; Japan bombs Pearl Harbor on December 7, sending the United States into World War II. Hopper and her husband separate the same year. </li>
        <li><strong>1943</strong> &mdash;  Leaves a secure job at Vassar College and joins the US Navy Reserve as a member of Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES).</li>
        <li><strong>1944</strong> &mdash; Assigned to the US Navy Bureau of Ships Computation Project in the Computation Lab at Harvard University. Hopper learns to program the first programmable computer in the US, the Mark I, which solves mathematical problems that until then required large teams of human “computers.”</li>
        <li><strong>1946</strong> &mdash; Becomes a lieutenant and decides to remain at Harvard as a researcher. She continues to work with Mark I and writes the 500-page Manual of Operations for the Automatic Sequence-Controlled Calculatora about how it works, producing the world's first computer programming manual. </li>
        <li> <strong>1949</strong> &mdash; Leaves Harvard and joins the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC) in Philadelphia, PA where she is in charge of programming the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC). </li>
        <li><strong>1952</strong> &mdash; Invents the first operational compiler. Called the A-0 compiler, it simplified programming by storing commonly used long strings of 0s and 1s in binary codes, assigning call numbers to the codes, and calling up those codes for use in new programs.</li>
        <li><strong>1958</strong> &mdash; Believing programming could become even more simple, Hopper programs the UNIVAC to translate letters into code. This new compiler, the B-0, is released under the name FLOW-MATIC. It allows programmers to write commands in English instead of binary code, making programming possible for non-mathematicians.</li>
        <li><strong>1959</strong> &mdash; Serves as technical consultant to the committee that develops a universal programming languge, which becomes the Common Business-Oriented Language (COBOL).</li>
        <li><strong>1966</strong> &mdash; Retires as a commander from the Navy, where she had continued to serve as a consultant and lecturer while at EMCC.
        <li><strong>1967</strong> &mdash; Takes a leave of absence from Sperry Rand Corp (formerly EMCC) to report for temporary active duty in the Navy, which requests her help setting up standards for COBOL software among all the Navy's computers.</li>
        <li><strong>1973</strong> &mdash; Promoted to US Navy captain.
        <li><strong>1985</strong> &mdash; Becomes a US Navy rear admiral.</li>
        <li><strong>1986</strong> &mdash; After serving on "temporary" active duty for 20 years, Hopper retires once more from the Navy, this time as the oldest officer on active naval duty, at age 79.</li>
        <li><strong>1992</strong> &mdash; Grace Hopper dies at her home in Arlington, VA at age 85, after continuing to work as a consultant and traveling the country giving lectures on the future of computing. She predicted that computers would one day be small enough to fit on a desk and people who were not professional programmers would use them in their everyday life. She is buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetary.</li>
