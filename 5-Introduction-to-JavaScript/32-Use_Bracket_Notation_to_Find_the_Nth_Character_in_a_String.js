//Bracket notation can be used to find characters in other locations, not just at the beginning. Just change the digit inside the brackets. Remembering to count 0 as the first digit!

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
