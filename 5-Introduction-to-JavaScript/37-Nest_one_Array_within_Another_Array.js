// Arrays can be nested inside other arrays. Just create the inner arrays with brackets, and put a comma between each inner array. Also called a multidimensional array.

// Example
var ourArray = [["the universe", 42], ["everything", 101010]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = [["Aspen", 81611], ["Snowmass", 81615]];
