// JavaScript allows you to insert variables inside a string. You need to use the concatenation operator ( + ) at each end of the inserted variable, with appropriate spacing. 

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Kathy";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
