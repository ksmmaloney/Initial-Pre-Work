//  JavaScript has operators that combine a mathematical operation and a value assignment in one step, like a shortcut. For addition, the operator is " += ". This operator will add a number to a variable and will assign the value in one step. 


var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only modify code below this line

a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;
