/*  JavaScript is flexible in the way that it lets you use quote marks in string values. You can use either single or double quotes as long as you start and end with the same type.

If you are inserting text that uses some kind of quote marks-- like as in a contraction (won't or can't), or a website address in quotes, or a quote which is something someone is saying something, "I have a dream"--you can avoid problems if you use one type of quotes at the beginning and end of a string, and a different kind of quotes for your content.
