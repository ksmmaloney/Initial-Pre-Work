/* Because a variable is first declared without a value, ( or "undefined") you have to give it a value if you want to do mathematical operations on it. Otherwise you'll get NaN, "Not a Number."

If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you'll get a string of "undefined".

I learned that the data types that got stored in a and b are numbers, and the data type of c is a string.
