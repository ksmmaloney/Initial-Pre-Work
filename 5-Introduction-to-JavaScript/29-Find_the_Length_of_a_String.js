//  If you need to find the length of a string value in terms of how many characters, you write .length after the string variable. In this example, what actually gets stored in lastNameLength is the value 8, and not the name Lovelace.

// Example
var firstNameLength = 0;
var firstName = "Ada";

firstNameLength = firstName.length;

// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
