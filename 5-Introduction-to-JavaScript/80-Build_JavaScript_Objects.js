// I learned that objects are meant to represent objects like in real life. Objects have properties that can describe them, and these properties are what you use to access the data in an object. Strings and numbers can both be stored as properties.


// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Red",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": .5,
  "friends": ["female people", "male people under age 10", "other dogs"]

};
