// Just as there's a method to access a character in a string, there's also a way to access data inside an array. "Array indexes" allow you to locate an ENTRY in an array, while a string index lets you find a CHARACTER. Array indexes also use bracket notation, and like strings, the first element is numbered 0.

// Example
var ourArray = [50,60,70];
var ourData = ourArray[0]; // equals 50

// Setup
var myArray = [50,60,70];

// Only change code below this line.
var myData = myArray[0];
