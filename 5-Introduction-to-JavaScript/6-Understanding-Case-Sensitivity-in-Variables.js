// Variables and function names are case sensitive in JavaScript, so be careful with capitalization. Using camelCase is a popular way to create variable names (if the name has more than one word). The first word is all lowercase. The first letter of each next word is capitalized. 


// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
