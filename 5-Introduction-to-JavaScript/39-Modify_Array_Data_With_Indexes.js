//  Array entries can be changed and are said to be "mutable," unlike strings which are immutable. Add one set of square brackets on the right side of the array name, with no spaces in between. Don't forget that counting starts at 0.


// Example
var ourArray = [18,64,99];
ourArray[1] = 45; // ourArray now equals [18,45,99].

// Setup
var myArray = [18,64,99];

// Only change code below this line.
myArray[0] = 45;
