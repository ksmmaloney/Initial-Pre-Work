//  In addition to "escaping" quote marks, you can escape things like backslashes and "invisible" formatting functions that go along with inserting text--things like adding a new line, using a tab, backspace, etc. Escaping allows you to insert these type of keyboard strokes without having errors in your code. All of these require putting a backslash \in front of the special characters.

var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"; // Change this line
