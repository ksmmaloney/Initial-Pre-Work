/*  You access an object's properties in two ways:
1. dot notation " . "
2. bracket notation " [ ] "  (similar to arrays)

Dot notation-use when you already know the property name

After you declare your variable, then insert the name of the object followed by a dot (.) then the known property name.

Note that if the property name has quote marks (it's a string), you don't need those quote marks when you write the property name again when you set the variable for accessing the property.
