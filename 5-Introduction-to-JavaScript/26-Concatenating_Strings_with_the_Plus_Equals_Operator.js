/* Similar to working with numbers, you can use the " += " operator to concatenate strings. You could use this to break up a long string onto several lines and avoid having one really long line of code.

I learned here to make sure and put an extra space after the period in the first sentence (between the period and the quote mark).
*/

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
