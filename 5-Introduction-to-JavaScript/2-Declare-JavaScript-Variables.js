/* I learned there are 7 data types in JavaScript:
-object
-boolean
-undefined
-null
-number
-string
-symbol
(together they make the acronym OBUNNSS)

Strings are collections of characters. There may be numbers included in a string, such as "123 cats" or the string "12," but computers can't perform math on strings, only on numbers.

Variables are names that represent data. They can contain any of the 7 data types. Also, they can store different values at different times.

Rules for variable names:
- they can be numbers, letters, $ or_, but cannot contain spaces or start with a number
- write variables in camelCase

// Example
var ourName;

// Declare myName below this line
var myName;
