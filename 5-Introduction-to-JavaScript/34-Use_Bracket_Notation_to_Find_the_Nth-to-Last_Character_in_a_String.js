// If you know how to get to the last character, use the same method to find a character near the end. But instead of subtracting one, you subtract a number that is "nth to the last".

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 3];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
