// Similar to " " ++ which increments a variable by one, you can use " -- " to decrement a variable by one. This method also eliminates use of the " = ". The entire line becomes: "variable name", with " -- " next to it, no spaces in between.


var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;
