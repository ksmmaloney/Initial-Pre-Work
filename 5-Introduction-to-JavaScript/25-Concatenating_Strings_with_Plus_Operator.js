// You can link or "concatenate" string values  together with the " + " operator. You can build new strings out of other strings in this way. Be sure to add spaces between the strings.



// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
