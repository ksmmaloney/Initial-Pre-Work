// I learned in this challenge about declaring another kind of variable: the data type "string". A string is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.


// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";

// Only change code below this line
var myFirstName = "Kathy";
var myLastName = "Maloney";
