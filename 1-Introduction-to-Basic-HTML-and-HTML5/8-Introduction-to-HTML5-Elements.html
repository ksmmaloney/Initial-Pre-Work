<!--I learned about some of the HTML5 tags which make your HTML easier to read, and help with SEO and accessibility. The main tag locates the main content of a page. Also, you can wrap elements by putting an opening tag before another element, then putting a closing tag after the wrapped element. The wrapped elements should be indented.-->
