<!--I learned another type of form input--radio buttons. Use them when you're giving the user a multiple choice option and you want only one answer.

Each radio button gets nested inside its own label element. The label elements are the "containers." They contain the text the user will see ("Indoor" and "Outdoor" in this case). The "content" of the input is a radio button (the input element). The name attribute that is applied to both radio buttons (indoor-outdoor) is what creates a "group" for the radio buttons to belong to. When buttons are linked together in the same group, the user can choose only one of the buttons. -->
