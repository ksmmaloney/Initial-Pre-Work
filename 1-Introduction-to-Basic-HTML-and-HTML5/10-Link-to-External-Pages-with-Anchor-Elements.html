<!--I learned that anchor elements (a) link to content outside of a web page. The href attribute (hypertext reference) provides the destination web address. Anchor text gives the user clickable text to get to the outside web address. Also, tag attributes always contain a key and a value. Here, the href is the key and the web address is the value.-->
