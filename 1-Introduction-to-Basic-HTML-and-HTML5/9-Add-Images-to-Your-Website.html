<!--I learned the img element adds images to your page and its source (src) attribute locates the image. Images should include an alt attribute, which describes what the image looks like in case the image doesn't load; you'll still get the context of the image. Alt attributes are also used with screen readers to describe the image to the user. Also, img elements are self closing.-->
