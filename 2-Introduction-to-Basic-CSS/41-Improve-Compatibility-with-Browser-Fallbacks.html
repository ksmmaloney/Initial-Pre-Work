/* A browser will ignore properties it can't recognize or support. (It's useful to learn that Internet Explorer doesn't support CSS variables.) In order to avoid having the browser revert to a default value, you should set up the CSS so the browser will find a secondary property value that you've chosen. Insert a more widely supported value right before your declaration. */
