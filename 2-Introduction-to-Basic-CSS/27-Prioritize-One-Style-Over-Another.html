/* */ Now getting into the details about why it's called Cascading Style Sheets and how one style gets applied over another. I learned that the class takes precedence over the body styling in this challenge  because the class is more "specific" to the text, and it's placed closer to the text.

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }

  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text">Hello World!</h1>
