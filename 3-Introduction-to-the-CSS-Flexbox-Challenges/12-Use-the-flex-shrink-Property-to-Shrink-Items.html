/* The properties I've learned so far--"flex-direction," "justify-content," "align-items," and "flex-wrap"--all pertain to the behavior of the flex container.  Other properties exist that change the behavior of the flex items inside the container. "Flex-shrink" shrinks an item if the flex container is too small; useful when the width of the container is smaller than the widths of all the items inside.  An item with a higher number will shrink more than the other item (value of 3 will shrink 3 times as much as a 1).*/
