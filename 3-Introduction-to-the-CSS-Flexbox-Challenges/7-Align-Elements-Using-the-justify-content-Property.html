/* I learned about several options for how you can arrange the items vertically and horizontally in a flex container. You use "justify-content" in the parent element along with a choice of settings: flex-start, flex-end, space-between, and space-around. In a row setting, the items are placed side by side. In a column setting, the items are placed on top of each other. You can reference a main axis, which is a horizontal line through the items in a row, and a vertical line for a column. */
