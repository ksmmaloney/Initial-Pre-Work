/* Another property that is specifically for flex items is the "align-self" property.  float, clear, and vertical-align do not work on flex items
also has to do with an individual flex item (as opposed to a property for the flex container)

Because using the "align-items" property on a parent container will align every item in that container the same way, "align-self" gives you the freedom to align individual items in a different way from the others. (This is useful because float, clear, and vertical-align do not work on flex items.)

"Align-self" will override anything set in the "align-items" property. You can use any of the same values you would use for "align-items" such as "center," "flex-end," "flex-start," "stretch" or "baseline." */
