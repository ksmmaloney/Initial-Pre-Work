/*  The previous 5 properties pertain to grid containers: "grid-template-columns," "grid-template-rows," "grid-column-gap," "grid-row-gap," and "grid-gap."

You can customize the grid items themselves. Using "grid-column" you can make grid items take up more than just one column. A grid is made up of vertical and horizontal lines, numbered starting with 1 at the top left corner of the grid and counting by one for each line that continues to the right and also going down. For the value, you specify a line number for where you want to start, and a number for where you want to end. "grid-column: 2 / 4" will select the second and third columns of a grid. (NOTE: you're choosing line numbers, not column numbers, such as "first column," "second column".)*/
